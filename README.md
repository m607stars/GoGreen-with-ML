**Predicting the energy output of wind turbine based on weather condition**

**Aim** - Develop a time series model to Predict the power output of wind farm based on the weather condition in the site (1Hr prediction to 72Hrs. prediction) Build an application to recommend the Power Grid to suggest the best time to utilize the energy from wind farm

# Methods
* First Used time series prediction using 3 different approaches to forecast Wind Speed and Direction 
* Having obtained the predicted wind speed and direction, we calculate estimated power generated using Neural Networks
